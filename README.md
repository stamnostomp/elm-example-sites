A collection of small Elm applications I've built while learning the Elm language and architecture.

## What I'm Learning

This project demonstrates different aspects of Elm through simple examples:

- **Counter**: Basic state management with simple increment/decrement
- **Todo List**: Managing lists of data with filtering and user input
- **Calculator**: More complex state logic and operations
- **Registration Form**: Form validation and feedback
- **Memory Game**: Side effects, randomization, and delayed operations

## How It Works

The `Main.elm` file serves as the coordinator for all modules, allowing you to select and load different examples. It maintains a list of available modules and handles navigation between them, demonstrating how to compose Elm applications from smaller components.

## Future Plans

As I continue learning, I plan to add:
- GraphQL integration examples
- SVG animations and visualizations
- WebSocket communication
- Single page application with routing
- Unit and fuzz testing examples

## Key Elm Concepts

- The Elm Architecture (Model, Update, View)
- Immutable data and type safety
- Pure functions and predictable state management
- Commands for managing side effects
